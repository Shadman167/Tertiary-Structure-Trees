# Trees

This is an exercise that dealt with tertiary structure trees(test of concept of binary structure trees).

TST involves a right child, middle child and left child. Similar to BST, I tested tree traversal techniques of the TST as well as adding and
removing childs from the trees. I was also tasked to find height, maximum and miniumum value of childs for the TST trees.

A few advanced features were to rebalance the entire tree but given time constraints the exercise specified the most simplified and basic
version of rebalance.
